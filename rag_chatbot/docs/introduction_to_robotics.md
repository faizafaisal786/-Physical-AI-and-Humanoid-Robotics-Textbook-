# Introduction to Robotics

Robotics is a branch of engineering and computer science that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep everyone safe.

## What is a Robot?

A robot is a programmable machine that can carry out a series of actions automatically. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from simple mechanical devices to complex machines equipped with artificial intelligence.

### Types of Robots

1. **Industrial Robots**: Used in manufacturing for tasks like welding, painting, and assembly
2. **Service Robots**: Designed to help humans, such as cleaning robots or medical assistants
3. **Humanoid Robots**: Designed to resemble humans in appearance and behavior
4. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars and drones

## Key Components

- **Sensors**: Gather information about the environment
- **Actuators**: Enable movement and manipulation
- **Controllers**: Process information and make decisions
- **Power Supply**: Provides energy for operation
